Project Overview
This repository provides hands-on implementations of key deep learning concepts, with a practical focus on plant analysis. The CNN model is tailored for tasks like plant disease detection or leaf classification, which can complement IoT-based soil health systems (e.g., monitoring pH, nutrients, or temperature for optimal plant growth). Other components include gradient descent for optimization, logistic regression for binary classification, loss functions to evaluate model performance, and regularization to prevent overfitting.
The code is written in Python using libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and scikit-learn, and is compatible with Google Colab or local environments. The project aligns with sustainable agriculture goals, such as improving crop health in Nashik’s soils through IoT and deep learning integration.
Features

CNN for Plant Analysis: Implements a CNN model to classify plant diseases or identify plant types from leaf images.
Gradient Descent: Demonstrates batch, stochastic, and mini-batch gradient descent for optimizing model parameters.
Logistic Regression: Includes a binary classifier for tasks like predicting soil health status (good/bad).
Loss/Cost Functions: Explores common loss functions (e.g., binary cross-entropy, mean squared error) with examples.
Regularization: Applies L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to prevent overfitting in models.
IoT Integration: Links to IoT-based soil health monitoring (e.g., pH, NPK levels) for real-world agricultural applications.


Tools:
Google Colab (recommended for cloud-based execution) or Jupyter Notebook.
Git for cloning the repository.


Optional: Access to a plant image dataset (e.g., PlantVillage dataset) for CNN training.

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-learning-plant-practicals.git
cd deep-learning-plant-practicals


Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Or manually install:
pip install tensorflow keras numpy scikit-learn matplotlib pandas


Google Colab Setup (alternative):

Upload the .ipynb files to Google Colab.
Install dependencies in a Colab cell:!pip install tensorflow keras numpy scikit-learn matplotlib pandas




Download Dataset (for CNN):

Obtain a plant image dataset (e.g., PlantVillage: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset).
Place the dataset in the data/ folder or update the dataset path in the code.


Usage

Run Notebooks:

Open a notebook (e.g., cnn_plant.ipynb) in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to load data, train models, and visualize results.
Example: For CNN, update the dataset path to your plant images and run all cells.


Run Scripts:

Execute Python scripts for specific tasks:python scripts/cnn_model.py


Modify script parameters (e.g., dataset path, hyperparameters) as needed.


Example Workflow:

CNN: Train a CNN model on plant images to classify diseases (e.g., leaf blight vs. healthy).
Logistic Regression: Use binary soil health data (0=bad, 1=good) to predict soil suitability.
Gradient Descent: Visualize optimization of a loss function for a simple dataset.
Loss Functions: Compare binary cross-entropy vs. mean squared error for classification.
Regularization: Apply L2 regularization to reduce overfitting in the CNN model.


IoT Integration:

Combine with IoT sensor data (e.g., pH, temperature, NPK from Nashik soils) to predict plant health.
Example: Use logistic regression to classify soil as “good” or “bad” based on sensor inputs (0/1).
